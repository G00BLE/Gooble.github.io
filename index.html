        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I have been invested in computers for a majority of my life. I was always fasinated how they worked and how they functioned. Ever since I was 10 I have been addicted to video games.</p>
        <p>I feel like video games and computers compliment eachother very well. In a game you try and figure out the pattern and same with programming. There is always a pattern you can look at. </p>
        <p>So I have always been intreged with figuring that pattern out and learning from it. </p>
